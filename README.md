 Code Vulnerability Assessment Tool

Overview
The *Code Vulnerability Assessment Tool* is a comprehensive solution for developers to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their code. It supports multiple programming languages and provides detailed analysis to ensure secure and robust applications.

 Features
- Cross-Platform Support: Analyze code written in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, and C++.
- Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection: Identifies common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
- Detailed Reports: Generates a report of detected vulnerabilities with suggested fixes.
- Disclaimer Popup: Provides ethical usage guidelines.

Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Code Analyzers: Custom analyzers for each supported language

 Supported Vulnerabilities
 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Description: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- Impact: Data theft, session hijacking, defacement.
- Prevention: Input sanitization, output encoding, Content Security Policy (CSP).

2. SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Description: Enables attackers to manipulate queries to a database via input fields.
- Impact: Data theft, unauthorized access, database corruption.
- Prevention: Use parameterized queries, ORM frameworks, and avoid direct SQL queries.
